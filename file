Q.2) Implement Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC) in Kubernetes

Setup and Deploy a Sample Application: 

Create a namespace called storage-demo. 

Deploy a sample application (e.g., Webserver) in the storage-demo namespace. Use the following specifications: 

Deployment name: my-deployment 

Image: nginx:latest 

Replicas: 2 

Expose the deployment using a service named service on port 80. 

Create a Persistent Volume (PV): 

Define a Persistent Volume with the following specifications: 

Name: my-pv 

Capacity: 2Gi 

Access Modes: ReadWriteOnce 

Host Path: /mnt/data 

Create a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC): 

Define a Persistent Volume Claim with the following specifications: 

Name: nginx-pvc 

Access Modes: ReadWriteOnce 

Storage Request: 2Gi 

Modify the Deployment to Use the PVC: 

Update the my-deployment to use the nginx-pvc for storing data. Mount the PVC to the path /usr/share/nginx/html in the container. 

Verify the Configuration: 

Ensure that the Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim are bound. 

Verify that the Nginx application is using the persistent storage by creating a test file in the mounted directory and checking its persistence across pod restarts.
